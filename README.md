# Swampert Reloaded
*Non è finita finchè non è finita*


## Prologue
Swampert Reloaded is a project born from the original [Swampert](https://github.com/DanieleDifra/Swampert), a home project made to remotely water balcony plants during the hot Milanese summers. It consists in a RaspberryPi used to control a pump and electrovalves driven by a handy Telegram Bot.


## Usage (debugging)
SSH can be used to access the Raspberry

```
ssh -Y swampi@192.168.1.230
```

Already planned improvements:
